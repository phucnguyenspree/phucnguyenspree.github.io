This region is located at the upper left side of the head, near the hairline, with the right ear positioned just 2 cm above, indicating proximity to the top of the head. The surrounding keypoints suggest the head is slightly tilted to the right, with the shoulders and elbows significantly lower, indicating a relaxed posture with the head as the focal point of this region.
Artifacts such as odd shapes or hair glitches appear in this region. Key details like hair texture or facial features are degraded or missing.
