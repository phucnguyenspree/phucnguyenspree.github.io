This region is centered around the left wrist, positioned at the bottom-right, indicating the hand is relaxed and hanging naturally beside the body. The proximity of the left elbow just above and the left hip slightly to the left suggests a casual stance with the arm extended downward, while the rest of the body remains upright.
Blurry textures or lighting problems reduce the quality of this region.
