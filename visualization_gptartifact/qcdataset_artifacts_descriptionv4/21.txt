This region captures the upper left arm, specifically the area around the left elbow, which is positioned at the top-right within the region, indicating a bent arm posture. The proximity of the left shoulder just 2 cm to the left and the head features slightly above suggests a relaxed stance with the arm raised or bent, possibly resting on the hip or held slightly outward.
