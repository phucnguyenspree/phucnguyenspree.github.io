This region captures the left wrist at the top-right, indicating the hand is positioned near the torso, likely in a relaxed state. The proximity of the left elbow 15 cm above and the left hip 6 cm to the left suggests the arm is bent slightly, with the hand resting close to the body, while the rest of the body remains upright.
Body proportions or synthesis look abnormal in this part.
