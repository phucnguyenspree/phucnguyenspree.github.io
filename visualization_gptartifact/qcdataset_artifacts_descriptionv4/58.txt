This region is located at the upper right side of the neck, just below the head, with the nose and right eye positioned slightly above and to the left, indicating a slight head tilt. The proximity of the left shoulder 4 cm below suggests this area encompasses the upper trapezius and neck, with the body oriented forward and the head slightly turned to the left.
Body proportions or synthesis look abnormal in this part. Personal items such as scarves or belts are not preserved accurately.
