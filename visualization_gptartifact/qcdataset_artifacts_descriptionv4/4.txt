This region captures the right wrist at the top, indicating the hand is positioned near the hip area, suggesting a relaxed stance with the arm hanging naturally. The proximity of the right hip just 3 cm to the right and the right elbow 25 cm above further supports the notion of a casual posture, with the body slightly angled to the right.
Body proportions or synthesis look abnormal in this part.
