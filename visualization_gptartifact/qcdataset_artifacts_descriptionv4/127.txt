----Answer-----:
This region is located on the upper right arm, positioned between the right shoulder 35 cm to the top-left and the right elbow 40 cm to the bottom-left, indicating it covers the mid-bicep area. With the left shoulder just 4 cm above and the left elbow 8 cm below, the arm appears to be slightly bent or relaxed at the side, suggesting a natural standing posture.
Body proportions or synthesis look abnormal in this part.
