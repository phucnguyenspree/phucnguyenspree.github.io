This region is located on the upper left arm, just below the shoulder, with the right shoulder positioned 4 cm to the top-right, indicating the area is near the deltoid muscle. The proximity of the right elbow 15 cm below suggests the arm is slightly bent, with the hand likely resting near the hip, as the wrist is further down at 42 cm to the bottom-right.
Visible artifacts or irregularities are present in this area, affecting realism.
