----Answer-----:
This region is centered around the lower right arm, specifically the forearm, with the left wrist positioned just 1 cm to the right, indicating a relaxed arm posture alongside the body. The proximity of the left elbow above and the left hip at the top-left suggests the arm is hanging naturally, with the hand near the hip area, while the rest of the body is oriented upright.
Artifacts such as odd shapes or hair glitches appear in this region.
