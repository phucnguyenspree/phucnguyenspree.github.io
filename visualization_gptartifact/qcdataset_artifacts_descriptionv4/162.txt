This region captures the lower right arm, specifically the area around the right wrist, which is positioned at the left within the region, suggesting a relaxed arm posture with the hand slightly turned inward. The proximity of the right elbow just above and the right hip directly to the right indicates the arm is hanging naturally alongside the body, with the torso upright and the legs extending downward.
Visible artifacts or irregularities are present in this area, affecting realism.
