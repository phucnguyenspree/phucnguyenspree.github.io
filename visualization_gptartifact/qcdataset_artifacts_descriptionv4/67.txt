This region captures the lower left arm, with the left elbow positioned at the top and the left wrist extending to the right, indicating a bent arm posture. The proximity of the left hip just 2 cm to the left suggests the arm is resting close to the body, while the shoulders and head are positioned significantly higher, indicating a relaxed stance with the arm hanging naturally.
Body proportions or synthesis look abnormal in this part.
