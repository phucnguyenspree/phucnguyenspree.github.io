----Answer-----:
This region is located along the right side of the torso, extending vertically from just below the right shoulder to the waist, with the right elbow positioned immediately to the left of the area. The proximity of the left wrist below and the right hip further down suggests a relaxed arm position, with the body standing upright and slightly turned to the left.
Body proportions or synthesis look abnormal in this part.
