The red region is positioned along the lower right forearm, just above the wrist, with the left wrist located a mere 1 cm to the right. This placement suggests a relaxed arm posture, with the hand hanging naturally by the side, while the rest of the body remains upright and slightly angled to the left.
Artifacts such as odd shapes or hair glitches appear in this region.
